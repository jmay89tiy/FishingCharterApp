# FishingCharterApp
This is a fishing charter app powered by bootstrap, JS, and more.

The concept of this is A website that hosts local "last minute savings" on fishing charters. In it's ideal state we will have developed a React front-end that displays a dynamic booking calendar, controlled by a React-Native app used for posting charter trips as captains as well as confirming new charters have been booked by customers coming from the site.

To Do List:
-----------------------------------------
1. Create dynamic booking calendar in React
2. Create React-Native app for Captains to post charter trips to the main calendar
3. Establish CRUD for dynamic calendar
4. Establish database of choice
5. and more.


This app features the following languages:
------------------------------------------
1. Javascript
2. Bootstrap 4
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. Jquery

This app focuses on the following:
-------------------------------------------
1. Gaining practical understanding of the front end using bootstrap
2. Creating a mockup of our proposed dynamic booking calendar app
3. Refreshing CSS skill sets
4. A sandbox for other future front-end language testing
